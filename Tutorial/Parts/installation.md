# Installation

Before any code can be run we must install the packages we want to use. It is assumed that **Perl6** (See [Perl6 Site](https://perl6.org/downloads/)) and the **GTK+** libraries (See [Gtk Site](https://www.gtk.org/)) are already installed. The program `zef` is used to install the modules. Enter the following command on the command line to install the most important modules `GTK::V3` and `GTK::Glade` with any other dependencies.

```
> zef install GTK::Glade
```
